# Widths-responsive

The inuitcss `widths-responsive` module is an extension of the default [`widths`
module](https://github.com/inuitcss/trumps.widths). 

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuit-widths-responsive

`widths-responsive` will inherit the same settings used for `widths` (i.e.
namespaces and fraction vs. spoken-word format).

`widths-responsive` loops through the breakpoints defined in
`settings.responsive` to generate prefixed breakpoint-based classes. If you are
using inuitcss’ default breakpoints, you will be given classes like
`lap-and-up-1/4`, or `desk-one-half`, etc.
