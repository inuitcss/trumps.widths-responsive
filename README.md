# Widths-responsive

The inuitcss `widths-responsive` module is an extension of the default [`widths`
module](https://github.com/inuitcss/trumps.widths).

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuit-widths-responsive

Install using npm:

    $ npm install --save inuit-widths-responsive


`widths-responsive` loops through the breakpoints defined in
`settings.responsive` to generate prefixed breakpoint-based classes. If you are
using inuitcss’ default breakpoints, you will be given classes like
`u-1/4-lap-and-up`, or `u-1-of-2-desk`, etc.
